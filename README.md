### Information and Disclaimer
Just because I work for Social Blade does not mean this is an official library. This is an unofficial library created for my personal convenience on my personal time.

This library supports most of the `api.socialblade.com` endpoints that are being exposed by either the official Social Blade Browser Extensions, Apps, or Website. Any endpoints that are not exposed publically will not be added until done so.

Social Blade's API is a private API used for Social Blade official tools and for companies with express written permission. Use of the Social Blade API without express permission is prohibited by the active [Terms of Service](https://socialblade.com/info/terms) and may result in being blocked from the Social Blade website and all of it's data.
